# ThreatSim
ThreatSim Cloud lets SOCs test their defenses daily—not yearly—by safely automating Red Team attacks and checking if their SIEM catches them.

The Problem:
Most organizations only test their defenses once a year during penetration tests, leaving their Security Operations Centers (SOCs) vulnerable to evolving threats. Blue Teams struggle to validate if their detections work until a real attack happens.
The Solution:
ThreatSim Cloud is a continuous attack simulation SaaS that automatically runs Red Team playbooks (like ransomware, APT, and cloud attacks) against a company’s defenses and validates if their SOC tools (Splunk, Sentinel, Elastic) detect them.
How It Works:
1.	Select a Threat Scenario
o	Choose from pre-built attacks (e.g., "Emulate Russian APT29" or "AWS S3 Data Exfiltration").
2.	Automated Execution
o	ThreatSim deploys safe, simulated attacks (no real damage) across networks, endpoints, and cloud.
3.	SIEM Integration
o	Attack logs are sent to the customer’s Splunk/Elastic/Sentinel to check if alerts fired.
4.	Purple Team Reporting
o	A dashboard shows:
	✅ Detected attacks (SOC did well).
	❌ Missed attacks (needs tuning).
	📊 MITRE ATT&CK mapping (track coverage).
Why It’s Unique:
•	"Caldera, but SaaS" – No self-hosting; just log in and attack.
•	Built for Blue Teams – Not just exploitation; focuses on detection gaps.
•	Compliance-Friendly – Meets PCI DSS, NIST CSF requirements for continuous testing.
Who It’s For:
•	SOCs – Validate & improve detections.
•	MSSPs – Offer continuous testing as a service.
•	Red Teams – Schedule automated adversary emulation.
Outcome: Organizations move from "annual pentests" to continuous security validation, reducing breach risk by 70%+ (Gartner
